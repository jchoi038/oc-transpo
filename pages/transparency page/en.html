										O-Train Line 1 &ndash; February 14
										service interruption details
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											General Manager, Transit Services
											Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of
											Council with further information
											regarding the O-Train Line 1 partial
											service impact on February 14 and OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s response to the
											incident.
										</p>

										<p>
											O-Train Line 1 experienced two,
											unrelated, stopped trains on
											Wednesday morning. This created a
											complex, evolving situation that
											required a fluid operational
											response. Customers travelling on
											Line 1 at the time of the incident
											experienced extended delays, and we
											apologize for this inconvenience.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong>First stopped train</strong>
										</p>

										<p>
											Shortly before 10am, a westbound
											train with approximately 50
											customers onboard stopped outside of
											Lees Station after the vehicle
											experienced a power loss.
											Preliminary indications are that the
											power loss may have been due to a
											mechanical fault with the pantograph
											which subsequently caused minor
											damage to the overhead catenary
											wire.
										</p>

										<p>
											Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM)
											technicians needed to assess that it
											was safe to exit the vehicle before
											customers could be safely escorted
											to Lees Station. We appreciate the
											patience of customers who were on
											the vehicle while this work was
											undertaken to ensure their continued
											safety. The vehicle is now being
											assessed by technicians to determine
											a more precise root cause.
										</p>

										<p>
											When this train initially stopped,
											Line 1 operated between Blair and
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture stations,
										</p>

										<p>
											with trains using a single track to
											travel between uOttawa and Hurdman
											stations.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Second stopped train</strong
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											At approximately 10:40am, a second
											train near uOttawa Station became
											immobilized due to an unrelated
											mechanical issue. Due to the
											location of this stopped train, it
											was no longer possible to continue
											travelling through the single track
											corridor, and R1 bus service was
											implemented to keep customers
											moving.
										</p>

										<p>
											This train was eventually cleared
											from the line around 12:30pm while
											repairs near Lees Station were
											underway. It will undergo further
											diagnostic testing.
										</p>

										<p>
											R1 bus service operated between
											Rideau and St-Laurent stations to
											allow RTM to safely make temporary
											repairs to the OCS near Lees
											Station. Line 1 service ran between
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and uOttawa
											stations in the west and Blair and
											Tremblay stations in the east.
											Repairs and inspections were
											completed shortly before 5pm and
											service in both directions at all
											stations was restored.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo enhanced the number of S1
											Shuttle Express buses operating
											between downtown and Blair Station
											during the afternoon commute to
											assist customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											This situation and the operational
											response evolved rapidly.
											Throughout, OC Transpo kept
											customers informed by providing
											updates on all communication
											channels, including octranspo.com,
											text messages and social media
											platforms. Staff were also at key
											stations to support customers and
											announcements were made at stations.
										</p>

										<p>
											RTM anticipates completing a more
											permanent repair to the impacted OCS
											this weekend during the maintenance
											period when the O-Train is not
											normally in service. At this time,
											it is not believed that this
											incident is related to current
											weather conditions or the issue that
											affected the OCS over the weekend.
											An investigation into the cause is
											underway to ensure appropriate
											mitigation measures are in place.
											Further information will be shared
											at an upcoming meeting of the
											Transit Commission.
										</p>

										<p>
											Again, OC Transpo extends our thanks
											to our customers for their patience
											while we worked torestore rail
											service.

										OC Transpo On-Demand transit pilot
										launch in Blackburn Hamlet
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											General Manager, Transit Services
											Department
										</p>

										<p>
											This memo is to advise the Mayor and
											Members of Council that the first
											phase of OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											On-Demand transit pilot project will
											launch on Sunday, February 11, 2024.
										</p>

										<p>
											During the soft launch of this first
											phase of testing, On-Demand buses
											will offer service in Blackburn
											Hamlet and to and from Blair Station
											and Gloucester Centre only on
											Sundays from 9 am to 6:30 pm and on
											select holidays. Route 28 will
											continue to operate on weekdays and
											Saturdays, and will also run on
											February 11, the first Sunday of the
											On-Demand transit pilot.
										</p>

										<p>
											The pilot will be extended in the
											future to include testing on both
											Saturdays and Sundays. This testing
											period will provide valuable
											feedback on the customer experience.
											Customers in Blackburn Hamlet are
											encouraged to provide feedback
											during the ongoing testing by using
											OC Transpo&rsquo;s website feedback
											form or by calling Customer Service
											at 613-560-5000.
										</p>

										<p>
											During the On-Demand pilot,
											participating customers can book
											same-day and next-day trips between
											select bus stops in Blackburn Hamlet
											and at Blair Station and Gloucester
											Centre using the On-Demand Transit
											Rider App on their mobile device, or
											by calling OC Transpo Customer
											Service.
										</p>

										<p>
											On-Demand transit uses technology to
											create responsive service, based on
											customer trip requests instead of
											traditional fixed routes and
											schedules. Software for the pilot
											project is being provided by
											Pantonium Inc. at no cost to the
											City through a grant from
											Sustainable Development Technology
											Canada. OC Transpo is working
											closely with Pantonium Inc. to
											continually test and improve the
											software to achieve optimal
											performance.
										</p>

										<p>
											The potential benefits of on-demand
											transit service can include shorter
											wait and travel times, shorter
											walking distances, increased travel
											options for customers, and lower
											emissions.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo hosted a public
											information session for Blackburn
											Hamlet residents on November 25,
											2023, and has provided information
											products to local residents. Updates
										</p>

										<p>
											on this new service are also being
											communicated in a variety of ways,
											including on-street signage, social
											media, and on octranspo.com.
										</p>

										<p>
											Further updates on the results of
											the pilot project and on future
											plans will be provided to the
											Transit Commission.
										</p>

											comments, please contact Pat
											Scrimgeour, Director, Transit
											Customer Systems and Planning, at

									Winter Storm Update: Transit Service
								</h4>

								<div class="accordion-content">
									<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

									<p>
										Ren&eacute;e Amilcar<br />
										General Manager, Transit Services
										Department
									</p>

									<p>
										The purpose of this memo is to provide
										an update to Mayor and Members of
										Council on transit operations following
										the first major winter storm of the
										year. The winter operations plan for
										bus, O-Train, and Para Transpo was
										implemented yesterday to maintain
										service throughout the storm. The
										exceptional work done by the Public
										Works Department to prioritize transit
										corridors and clear roads was a critical
										factor in keeping transit moving.
									</p>

									<h5>Line 1 Service</h5>

									<p>
										Line 1 service operated throughout the
										storm period and launched this morning
										as planned with double car-trains.
									</p>

									<p>
										OC Transpo worked with Rideau Transit
										Maintenance (RTM) to implement the
										winter weather operations plan to
										maintain reliable service. This included
										having seven trains in operation
										overnight to prevent ice buildup on the
										overhead wires and clear the tracks of
										snow, maximizing the number of carbon
										strips installed on the fleet, and
										deploying staff to monitor key rail
										infrastructure, like switches.
										Additionally, de-icing solution was
										applied to the overhead catenary wires
										to further mitigate possible ice
										buildup.
									</p>

									<h5>
										Conventional Service and Para Transpo
									</h5>

									<p>
										Yesterday afternoon all road users
										including transit operators faced
										challenging road conditions and delays
										were experienced throughout the bus and
										Para Transpo network. The safety of our
										staff and customers is OC
										Transpo&rsquo;s number one priority and
										operators adjust their driving behaviour
										based on the conditions.
									</p>

									<p>
										Throughout the weather event updates
										were shared on octranspo.com, our social
										media platforms and real-time
										information was available for customers
										on the Transit App. Updates will
										continue to be shared with customers on
										all channels.
									</p>

									<p>
										OC Transpo and RTM are monitoring the
										forecast and are proactively preparing
										for another possible weather event this
										weekend. OC Transpo is ready to continue
										to deliver service, and customers are
										encouraged to plan their trips on
										octranspo.com or use the Transit App to
										get real-time updates on their trips.

									O-Train Line 1 returns to double-car train
									service
								</h4>

								<div class="accordion-content">
									<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

									<p>
										From: Richard Holder<br />
										Acting General Manager, Transit Services
										Department
									</p>

									<p>
										The purpose of this memo is to advise
										the Mayor and Members of Council that OC
										Transpo will provide double-car train
										service on O-Train Line 1 beginning on
										Monday, January 8.
									</p>

									<p>
										Double-car trains will operate on
										weekdays. The larger trains will
										accommodate customer volumes during the
										busiest times on the system, improving
										customer comfort. Trains will operate
										approximately every five to six minutes.
									</p>

									<p>
										The move to double-car trains is due to
										a new measure that extends the life of
										the wheel hub assemblies on the vehicles
										while continuing to ensure the ongoing
										safe operation of the fleet.
									</p>

									<h5>Wheel hub assembly nut pinning</h5>

									<p>
										At the joint Transit Commission and
										Light Rail Subcommittee meeting on
										December 14, 2023, an update was
										provided on a proposal to add pins to
										the restraining nut on the axle hubs to
										extend their useable life. Axle hub
										assemblies are currently required to be
										replaced every 60,000 km as part of the
										containment plan outlined in the Alstom
										Safety Note. This has been complicated
										by supply chain issues and required the
										careful management of the fleet to
										sustain service, including the use of
										single-car trains.
									</p>

									<p>
										Rideau Transit Maintenance (RTM) has
										completed the necessary testing and
										analysis of the proposed nut pinning
										solution. OC Transpo and Transportation
										Resource Associates (TRA) are satisfied
										that safety requirements have been met
										and the hub assemblies with the nut
										pinning solution can now be deployed to
										in-service vehicles. This added measure
										allows for the immediate return to
										double-car trains on Line 1.
									</p>

									<p>
										The rigorous inspections and maintenance
										requirements in Alstom&rsquo;s Safety
										Note remain as a containment measure
										until the vehicle supplier is confident
										the program can be amended.
									</p>

									<p>
										In addition, a test train will operate
										during regular service hours over the
										next couple of months to gather
										additional data for ongoing safety
										assurance. This testing allows for early
										detection of potential issues. Customers
										may occasionally see this out-of-service
										test train on Line 1.
									</p>

									<p>
										Further information and updates on the
										ongoing work to improve train
										reliability will be shared as it becomes
										available.

										Winter Readiness: Line 1 Service
										Preparations and Procedures
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From: General Manager<br />
											Transit Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of
											Council with information on the
											proactive winter readiness
											activities on O-Train Line 1 and new
											procedures to respond to severe
											winter weather events.
										</p>

										<p>
											As detailed at the Transit
											Commission meeting on December 14,
											OC Transpo started working with its
											maintainer, Rideau Transit
											Maintenance (RTM), to implement its
											light rail winter readiness plan
											early in the fall. The focus is on
											making proactive enhancements to
											maintain rail service, implement
											lessons learned and build upon the
											successes from previous winters.
											Enhancements include:
										</p>

										<p></p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Improved process for
												communications, planning and
												coordination with RTM
											</li>
											<li>
												Enhanced weather monitoring and
												forecasting to provide
												additional lead time for
												operational teams
											</li>
											<li>
												Additional staff deployed to
												monitor in-service conditions
												and remote monitoring for
												electrical anomalies
											</li>
											<li>
												Application of anti-icing
												solution to the overhead
												catenary wires
											</li>
											<li>
												Procurement of a diesel-powered
												tow vehicle by RTM
											</li>
											<li>
												Increasing the number of winter
												carbon strips installed on
												trains
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p></p>

										<p>
											Based on lessons learned, the severe
											winter weather procedure for Line 1
											has been updated. Under this
											procedure, staff will monitor key
											areas of the line for ice buildup
											during a freezing rain event both in
											the field and by camera from the
											Transit Operations Control Centre.
											Additionally, RTM will be monitoring
											train diagnostics and system power
											for indications that service
											adjustments may be required to avoid
											a full disruption to Line 1 or
											damage to tracks or vehicles.
										</p>

										<p>
											When the forecast calls for extreme
											winter weather, service adjustments
											to Line 1 will be considered. This
											may include running trains overnight
											to keep tracks clear, temporary
											speed restrictions, reducing train
											frequency or the suspension of
											service in specific segments or all
											of Line 1. These actions are to
											ensure the safety of staff and
											customers, the protection of track
											infrastructure and vehicles, and
											will allow service to resume more
											quickly.
										</p>

										<p>
											This procedure will follow a similar
											process as the bus Severe Storm
											Schedule and will only be
											implemented during the most severe
											weather conditions. It is not
											anticipated that it will be
											implemented frequently. OC Transpo
											is responding to lessons learned
											from previous winter events to
											ensure plans are in place to provide
											safe and reliable light rail service
											to its customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											Information for customers during
											weather events will be shared on all
											communications channels. This will
											include frequent service alerts,
											updates to OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											website, signage at bus stops, and
											public service announcements.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo is committed to
											continuous improvement and will
											continue to review and implement
											changes to operational procedures
											based on lessons learned and best
											practices.
										</p>

										Update on Repairs to Roosevelt Bridge
										and West Transitway Detour
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From: General Manager<br />
											Transit Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of
											Council with an update on the
											ongoing repairs to the temporary
											Roosevelt Bridge, at the north end
											of Roosevelt Avenue near Dominion
											Station, and the ongoing detour of
											the Transitway between Westboro and
											Lincoln Fields stations.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong>Bridge repair works</strong>
										</h5>

										<p>
											Yesterday, the contractor installed
											a patch at the expansion joint
											between the bridge deck and road
											surface. After reviewing and testing
											this patch, it was determined a
											higher quality repair would be
											required to withstand frequent bus
											traffic. The bridge will remain
											closed while this repair is
											completed over the weekend.
										</p>

										<p>
											Today, the contractor will continue
											to work on a robust, technical
											repair. This will include the
											removal of the plate and an angle
											bracket at the expansion joint,
											concrete work, installation of new
											bolts for bracket attachments and
											reinstatement of both the concrete
											and the bracket. The goal is to have
											the repair completed by Monday
											morning, which may require overnight
											work this weekend. While overnight
											work is generally avoided to reduce
											impacts on area residents,
											sufficient time is needed to be able
											to pour cold-weather concrete and
											ensure it has enough time to cure
											properly prior to opening. It is
											anticipated that these repairs will
											allow buses to safely resume
											operation on the bridge.
										</p>

										<p>
											Work will continue throughout the
											day and this weekend to complete
											this additional work. Further
											updates on the repairs and the
											re-opening of the bridge to buses
											will be provided by Sunday, November
											26.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong>Transit Services</strong>
										</h5>

										<p>
											Buses continue to be on detour via
											Churchill Street, Richmond Road and
											Carling Avenue. This morning, the
											detour route ran well, and lower
											traffic volumes were observed. The
											Transit Operations Control Centre
											(TOCC) and the Traffic Control
											Centre are working together to
											monitor traffic volumes and make
											adjustments as required. Transit
											staff will be at key locations
											during the afternoon peak period to
											support customers during their
											trips.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo recognizes that this
											longer route is causing delays to
											customer travel time and increased
											trip cancellations. We thank
											customers for their patience as we
											work to safely restore bus service
											in this corridor.
										</p>

										<p>
											A number of measures have been put
											in place with Traffic Services to
											prioritize bus service along the
											detour route, including posting no
											parking and stopping and adjusting
											signal timing to assist bus
											movements at intersections.

											service level next week as it is
											anticipated that customer demand may
											be higher during the morning and
											afternoon peak periods.
										</p>

										<p>
											Beginning on Monday, September 11,
											OC Transpo will introduce double-car
											trains as an enhancement to rail
											service. The number of single-car
											trains in operation will increase
											from 13 to 17, with some of these
											operating in the two-car
											configuration throughout the day to
											provide customers with frequent
											service. Trains will operate
											approximately every four minutes at
											the busiest times of the morning and
											afternoon commute.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo anticipates that this
											service frequency will provide
											sufficient capacity for customers.
											The operations team will continue to
											closely monitor and adjust service
											as needed.
										</p>

										<p>
											In addition, the Shuttle Express
											continues to operate every 10
											minutes during weekday morning and
											afternoon rush hours. Ridership on
											the shuttle service between Blair
											Station and downtown has remained
											steady with about 50 customers per
											trip. Ridership between
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture Station and
											downtown is significantly lower with
											approximately five to 10 customers
											per trip.
										</p>

										<p>
											As a result, the last day of
											operations for the Shuttle Express
											service between Tunney&rsquo;s
											Pasture and downtown will be today,
											September 8. The western shuttle
											will not operate beginning on
											Monday, September 11. The shuttle
											service in the east will continue to
											operate. OC Transpo will continue to
											monitor ridership levels.
										</p>

										<p>
											Customers looking for the most
											up-to-date information about their
											trips, can use the
											<u>travel planner</u>, call
											613-560-1000 or text 560560 and
											enter your bus stop number.

											Chair and Members of the Transit
											Commission
										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;Acting General Manager<br />
											Transit Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of
											Council with an overview of OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s fall service
											changes, effective Sunday, August
											27, 2023. Regular schedule
											adjustments take place four times a
											year &ndash; spring, summer, fall
											and winter &ndash; and memos are
											provided in advance of each new
											schedule period.
										</p>

										<p>
											The fall service change includes
											several types of adjustments:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Service adjustments</li>
											<li>
												Service adjustments for
												construction
											</li>
											<li>Seasonal service changes</li>
										</ul>

										<p><u>Service Adjustments</u></p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												On weekdays, service on O-Train
												Line 1 during peak periods will
												operate every five minutes and
												will be monitored and increased
												based on observed ridership
												levels, as outlined in the memo
												on August 14, 2023. On weekends,
												service on Line 1 will operate
												every 10 minutes.
											</li>
											<li>
												The Shuttle Express service that
												began on August 15, 2023, will
												continue to operate as an
												alternative to O-Train Line 1.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, a supplemental trip
												on Route 7 will be added in the
												evening, from Carleton
												University to the Rideau Centre,
												to increase capacity and better
												accommodate current ridership
												levels.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 18 will be extended to
												Parliament Station via Queen
												Street.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, westbound morning
												trips on Route 51 will be
												adjusted to follow the regular
												routing via Lincoln Heights
												instead of remaining on Croydon
												Avenue, to provide consistent
												and more reliable service.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekends, select trips on
												Route 61 will be extended
												between Terry Fox Station and
												CARDELREC Recreation Complex
												Goulbourn on Shea Road to
												improve transit connectivity to
												employment areas, principally on
												Stittsville Main Street.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, as part of the
												regular review of schedules to
												improve service reliability for
												customers, schedule adjustments
												will be made to Routes 74 and 75
												to improve on-time performance.
												The same number of trips will
												still provide the same capacity.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 74 will be extended from
												Nepean Woods Station to
												Riverview Station, in
												preparation for the future
												further extension to Limebank
												Station when O-Train Line 2
												opens.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
												On weekdays, one trip northbound
												in the morning and one trip
												southbound in the afternoon on
												Route 75 will be extended
												between Barrhaven Centre Station
												and Cambrian (Minto Recreation
												Complex), to better reflect
												ridership levels south of
												Barrhaven Centre Station.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, new trips on Route
												88 will be added between
												Baseline and Hurdman Stations,
												to increase capacity and better
												accommodate current ridership
												levels.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, the short trips on
												Route 198 that do not serve
												Greenboro Station will be
												withdrawn, due to very low
												ridership.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											<u
												>Service Adjustments for
												Construction</u
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											As a result of road reconstruction
											and other infrastructure projects,
											the following routes may experience
											delays and additional travel time:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Routes 10 and 16, due to ongoing
												road reconstruction along Albert
												and Slater Streets, between
												Empress Avenue and Bay Street.
											</li>
											<li>
												Routes 11, 16, and 19, due to
												the ongoing rehabilitation
												project of the Mackenzie King
												Bridge.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 16 and Gatineau trips on
												Routes 57, 61, 63, 66, and 75,
												due to road reconstruction on
												Scott Street between Parkdale
												Avenue and Bayview Road
												(westbound direction only).
											</li>
											<li>
												Transitway service between
												Westboro Station and Lincoln
												Fields Station will continue to
												be detoured every night due to
												Stage 2 rail construction.
												Starting on Tuesday, September
												5, the detour start time will be
												set back from 10:30 p.m. to
												11:30 p.m. to accommodate
												students returning to evening
												classes. Service is also being
												detoured on weekends until
												Monday, October 9, when NCC bike
												day closures end for the year.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><u>Seasonal Service Changes</u></p>

										<p><em>Seasonal Adjustments</em></p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Frequency on Line 2 replacement
												buses serving Carleton
												University will be increased
												from summer service levels to
												accommodate the seasonal return
												of higher ridership. Peak period
												service will operate every 10
												minutes, and midday and evening
												service will operate every 12
												minutes. Additional trips will
												operate at major class times
												where needed to increase
												capacity.
											</li>
											<li>
												Routes 25, 56, and 57 will
												return to their regular
												non-summer schedules.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>

										O-Train Line 1 &ndash; Required Track
										Adjustments
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											To: Mayor and Members of Council<br />
											From:&nbsp;Michael Morgan<br />
											Acting General Manager, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											inform the Mayor and Members of
											Council that during enhanced track
											inspections put in place since
											O-Train Line 1 service resumed on
											Monday, August 14, contact was
											observed between a restraining rail
											and the wheels of a light rail
											vehicle between Hurdman Station and
											the Rideau River Bridge. Out of an
											abundance of caution O-Train Line 1
											is now running on one track between
											Hurdman and Lees Station to make
											further track adjustments in this
											area.
										</p>

										<p>
											As previously advised, the Safety
											Note from Rideau Transit Group (RTG)
											and Alstom requires that there can
											be no contact between the
											restraining rail and wheels as part
											of the safe return to service plan.
											To accommodate further track
											assessment and make the necessary
											adjustments, trains are not
											operating on the section of
											westbound track between Hurdman and
											uOttawa stations. No contact has
											been observed elsewhere on the line,
											and therefore it is safe to continue
											rail operations on the remainder of
											the system.
										</p>

										<p>
											As a result, Line 1 service
											continues to operate between
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and Blair
											stations approximately every
											15-minutes, and customers should
											expect delays as trains travel
											through the section of single track
											between uOttawa and Hurdman
											stations. To supplement rail service
											during the afternoon peak period,
											the following service is being
											implemented:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Shuttle Express will be enhanced
												from operating every 10 minutes
												to every five minutes from 3 to
												6 pm between downtown and the
												terminus stations at
												Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture Station
												and Blair Station.
											</li>
											<li>
												Customers travelling to an
												intermediate station, including
												Bayview, Pimisi, Lyon,
												Parliament, Rideau, uOttawa,
												Lees, Hurdman, Tremblay, St.
												Laurent, and Cyrville should use
												Line 1 to go to their
												destination.
											</li>
											<li>
												Para Transpo will take same day
												requests for trips between Line
												1 stations; customers should
												call 613-560-5000 to book the
												service.
											</li>
											<li>
												Staff will also be present at
												stations to support customers
												during their trips.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											OC Transpo continues to monitor
											service and will make adjustments to
											respond to customer volumes if
											required.
										</p>

										<p>
											RTG will be making adjustments to
											the restraining rail overnight in
											order to restore service in the
											affected section of the line. It is
											currently anticipated that Line 1
											will resume normal operations on
											Friday, August 18, but further
											investigation and testing will be
											required before the service plan for
											Friday is confirmed. Additional
											updates will be provided as more
											information becomes available.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo, RTG and Alstom continues
											to closely monitor and inspect the
											track and trains to ensure the
											ongoing safe operations for our
											customers and employees.
										</p>

										<p>
											Customer information is being
											communicated through various
											channels, including customer alerts,
											social media updates, signage at
											Line 1 stations, and on
											octranspo.com. Customers can visit
											octranspo.com and use OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s travel planner for
											travel planning assistance or call

										</p>

										<p>
											Trial running has been carried out
											to ensure that all train systems are
											functioning, and preparatory
											activities have been done to ensure
											that all stations are ready to
											welcome customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											On Monday, August 14, customers can
											expect the following service:&nbsp;
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Line 1 will operate between
												Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and Blair
												stations
											</li>
											<li>
												During the morning peak period,
												11 single-car trains will
												provide service every five
												minutes
											</li>
											<li>
												During the afternoon peak
												period, 13 single-car trains
												will provide service every four
												minutes
											</li>
											<li>
												During the rest of the day and
												on weekends, nine single-car
												trains will provide service
												every 6 minutes
											</li>
											<li>
												This level of service will meet
												customer volumes throughout the
												day
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											R1, R1 Express, and R1 Para service

											with customers on all platforms and
											on octranspo.com. Staff will also be
											at stations to support customers
											during their trips. Attached are
											additional communication materials

											information with their communities.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Ongoing Track and Vehicle
												Work</strong
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											As previously mentioned, Rideau
											Transit Group (RTG) completed
											repositioning of the restraining
											rails at 16 locations to fulfill the
											last requirement of the Safety Note
											from RTG and Alstom. Testing was
											successfully conducted over the
											weekend to confirm the work and the
											system&rsquo;s readiness to safely
											welcome customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo, together with
											Transportation Resource Associates
											(TRA), have conducted a final review
											of RTG&rsquo;s documentation to
											confirm that the requirements for
											the restart of full Line 1 service
											have been met. These documents have
											been provided to the Interim City
											Manager, with a recommendation to
											resume service. The City Manager is
											satisfied that the regulatory regime
											is in compliance, and has agreed
											with the recommendation to resume
											service on August 14, at 5am.
										</p>

										<p>
											In parallel to the track
											infrastructure work, RTG also
											continues the required replacement
											of the wheel hub assemblies on the
											train fleet, and replacements are
											now complete on 28 trains. The
											ongoing replacements increase the
											number of cars available to go into
											service.&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											We will continue to provide updates

										</p>

										<p>
											This memo is to provide the Mayor
											and Members of Council with an
											update on the ongoing O-Train Line 1
											service disruption and the safe
											return to service.
										</p>

										<h4>R1 Service</h4>

										<p>
											R1, R1 Express, and R1 Para services
											continue to operate. An update was
											sent early this morning regarding
											the status of service for today.
										</p>

										<h4>Safe return to service.</h4>

										<p>
											Yesterday, partial Line 1 service
											between Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and
											uOttawa stations began. Rail service
											is running well, with single-car
											trains operating every five minutes
											to meet current customer volumes.
											The Transit Operations Control
											Centre is monitoring service closely
											and can launch an additional train
											if required to accommodate
											customers. Staff are at stations
											supporting customers during their
											trips, and updates continue to be
											shared on all of OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											customer information channels.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo continues to anticipate
											that full Line 1 service will resume
											on August 14. Further updates will
											be provided as they become
											available.
										</p>

										<h4>Ongoing Investigation</h4>

										<p>
											Rideau Transit Group (RTG) continues
											to work to adjust the restraining
											rails to prevent contact between the
											train wheel and the rail. As
											previously noted, this is the final
											requirement of the Safety Note from
											RTG and Alstom that remains to be
											fulfilled to safely restore service
											across the entire Line 1 corridor.
											To date, 12 of the 16 locations have
											been repositioned.
										</p>

										<p>
											RTG also continues the required
											replacement of the wheel hub
											assemblies on the train fleet, and
											replacements are now complete on 25
											trains. The ongoing replacements
											increase the number of cars
											available to go into service.
										</p>

										<p>
											There will be a special virtual
											information session today from 2:30
											to 4pm to provide an opportunity for
											Members of Council to ask questions
											and receive an update. A media
											availability will follow the
											session.

										</p>

										<h4>Safe return to service.</h4>

										<p>
											Today, Line 1 resumed operation
											between Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and
											uOttawa stations. Single-car trains
											are running every five minutes. An
											additional train can be launched
											during peak periods to accommodate
											higher customer volumes if required.
											So far, this service is sufficient
											to meet customer needs. Staff are at
											stations supporting customers during
											their trips, and updates continue to
											be shared on all of OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s channels
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo anticipates that full
											Line 1 service will resume on August
											14. Service plans continue to be
											finalized, but it is anticipated
											that for the rest of August, 11
											single-car trains will operate
											during the morning peak period and
											13 single-cars will run in the
											afternoon peak. For the remainder of
											the day, nine single-car trains will
											provide service. This will
											accommodate current customer demand
											during the busiest times, without
											the need for R1 bus service, and
											allow OC Transpo to sustainably
											manage fleet availability over the
											long term.
										</p>

										<p>
											The service plan for September
											ridership is still being prepared,
											and an update will be provided when
											final.
										</p>

										<h4>Ongoing Investigation</h4>

										<p>
											As previously noted, adjusting the
											restraining rails to prevent any
											contact between the train wheel and
											the rail is the final requirement of
											the Safety Note from Rideau Transit
											Group (RTG) and Alstom that remains
											to be fulfilled to safely restore
											service across the entire Line 1
											corridor.
										</p>

										<p>
											Since August 3, RTG completed
											adjustments to the restraining rails
											between Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and
											uOttawa stations. This allowed
											partial Line 1 service to safely
											resume today in this section of the
											line. Work on the remaining
											restraining rails continues across
											the rest of the alignment. To date,
											10 of 16 locations have been
											repositioned.
										</p>

										<p>
											RTG also continues the required
											replacement of the wheel hub
											assemblies on the train fleet, and
											replacements are now complete on 24
											trains. The ongoing replacements
											increase the number of cars
											available to go into service.
										</p>

										<p>
											There will be a media availability
											today at 4pm.
										</p>

										<p>
											In addition, a virtual Councillor
											information session will be held on
											Wednesday, August 9 from 2:30 to 4pm
											to provide an opportunity for
											Members of Council to ask questions
											and receive an update. The regular
											media availability will follow the
											session.

										O-Train Line 1 - Gradual Service
										Resumption
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											To: Mayor and Members of Council<br />
											From:&nbsp;Ren&eacute;e Amilcar,
											General Manager, Transit Services
											Department
										</p>

										<p>
											This memo is to provide Mayor and
											Members of Council with an update on
											the safe, gradual resumption of
											service on O-Train Line 1. Partial
											service will be restored between
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and uOttawa
											stations on Tuesday, August 8.
										</p>

										<p>
											As previously noted, adjusting the
											restraining rails to prevent any
											contact between the train wheel and
											the rail is a requirement of the
											Safety Note from Rideau Transit
											Group (RTG) and Alstom, which must
											be fulfilled to safely restore
											service. RTG has been working since
											Thursday, August 3 to reposition
											restraining rails across the
											alignment. The required work between
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and uOttawa
											stations is complete, and OC Transpo
											has conducted trial running in this
											section to confirm that all train
											systems are safe and ready for
											service.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo, together with
											Transportation Resource Associates
											(TRA), is conducting a final review
											of RTG&rsquo;s documentation to
											confirm that the requirements for
											partial service have been met. These
											documents will be provided to the
											Interim City Manager, who has
											delegated authority in this matter,
											with a recommendation to resume
											service. Based on the information,
											once the City Manager is satisfied
											that the regulatory regime is in
											compliance, and agrees with the
											recommendation, OC Transpo will
											proceed with partial service
											resumption.
										</p>

										<h4>Line 1 Service</h4>

										<p>
											As it has been deemed safe, OC
											Transpo is now able to begin
											gradually restoring service by
											providing partial Line 1 service in
											the west beginning on Tuesday,
											August 8 at 5am. For customers this
											means:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Line 1 service will operate
												between Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture
												and uOttawa stations
											</li>
											<li>
												Five single-car trains will
												provide service every five
												minutes
											</li>
											<li>
												R1, R1 Express and Para R1
												services will continue to
												operate with no changes
											</li>
											<li>
												An additional train can be
												launched during peak periods to
												accommodate high customer
												volumes
											</li>
											<li>
												Customers may notice slower
												train speeds in the tunnel due
												to a speed restriction as part
												of safety requirements during
												the gradual resumption of
												service
											</li>
											<li>
												Staff will be at stations
												supporting customers during
												their trips
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											RTG also continues the required
											replacement of the wheel hub
											assemblies on the train fleet, and
											replacements are now complete on 22
											trains. By operating with single-car
											trains, OC Transpo can accommodate
											current customer volumes and manage
											the fleet availability over the long
											term.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo has completed a number of
											preparatory activities in the west
											end of the line to provide a
											positive customer experience.
										</p>

										<p>These Include:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Trial running between
												Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and
												uOttawa stations to verify train
												systems
											</li>
											<li>Cleaning stations</li>
											<li>
												Reactivating escalators and
												elevators
											</li>
											<li>
												Verifying all announcement
												systems are working and updating
												messages
											</li>
											<li>
												Placing wayfinding signage for
												station navigation
											</li>
											<li>Preparing outreach staff</li>
											<li>
												Installing new decals to
												identify single-car boarding
												locations at the platforms
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											Information on the safe, gradual
											restart of service is being shared
											with customers on all platforms and
											on octranspo.com. Attached are
											additional communication materials
											to support Councillors in sharing
											information with their communities.
										</p>

										<p>
											Work on the remaining restraining
											rails continues across the rest of
											the alignment. To date, nine of 16
											locations have been repositioned. OC
											Transpo anticipates that full Line 1
											service will resume on August 14.
										</p>

										<p>
											There will be a media availability
											today at 1pm, and we will continue
											to share information as it becomes
											available

										<p>
											As advised yesterday, adjustments to
											the restraining rails have begun.
											RTG is working at the 16 locations
											that have been identified for
											adjustments. A few remaining items
											in the Atkins Global report are
											being finalized, and the risk
											assessment is almost complete.
										</p>

										<p>
											In parallel, RTG also continues to
											replace the wheel hub assemblies on
											the light rail vehicles. To date, 19
											trains have had their hub assemblies
											replaced. RTG can replace two hubs
											every two days. The ongoing
											replacements increase the number of
											cars available to operate when it is
											safe to resume service.
										</p>

										<h4>Resumption of Service</h4>

										<p>
											As this work proceeds, OC Transpo is
											also preparing to welcome back
											customers and we are taking the
											necessary measures to ensure we are

										<h4>Fleet availability</h4>

										<p>
											Important progress continues to be

											assemblies to increase the
											availability of the train fleet. To
											date, 18 light rail vehicles have
											had their hub assemblies replaced.
											The ongoing replacements increase

											Based on the information noted
											above, OC Transpo continues to
											estimate that Line 1 service may be
											able to safely resume as early as
											August 14. This continues to be an
											early estimate, based on projected
											timelines for these action items. As
											work continues to progress, we will
											provide an update on the potential
											timing to gradually restart service.
										</p>

										<h4>Fleet availability</h4>

										<p>
											Progress continues to be made on
											changing the wheel hub assemblies to
											increase the availability of the
											train fleet. To date, 15 light rail
											vehicles have had their hub
											assemblies replaced. The ongoing
											replacements increase the number of
											cars available to operate, when it
											is safe to resume service. Our team
											is proactively preparing service
											plans based on the projected number
											of vehicles that may be available.
										</p>

										<p>
											There will be a media availability
											at 4pm and we will continue to share
											information as it becomes available.

										<h4>R1 Service</h4>

										<ul>
											<li>
												R1 bus service continues to
												operate, and an update was sent
												early this morning regarding the
												status of service.
											</li>
											<li>
												R1 Express service was
												successfully launched this
												morning from Blair to downtown.
												This service operates in
												addition to the R1 bus service
												and normal bus routes. The
												Express service is operating in
												the opposite direction from
												downtown to Blair beginning at
												3pm this afternoon and provides
												customers with additional travel
												options at the busiest times of
												the day. OC Transpo continues to
												monitor the service and will
												makeadjustments, where possible.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h4>Ongoing Investigation</h4>

										<p>
											As previously indicated, to safely
											resume service, there are three
											milestones that must be achieved:
										</p>

										<ol>
											<li>
												Inspection of all light rail
												vehicles:
												<ul>
													<li>
														This was completed on
														July 24; six vehicles
														are undergoing
														additional
														investigations.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												Texelis report based on the
												manufacturer&rsquo;s disassembly
												and analysis of the out of
												tolerance hub:
												<ul>
													<li>
														The Texelis report was
														received on July 28.
														Rideau Transit Group
														(RTG) and Alstom have
														completed the analysis
														and confirmed that the
														degradation of the wheel
														hub is similar to what
														was found on the hub
														assemblies in the
														previous two incidents
														in August 2021 and July
														2022. This reinforces
														Alstom&rsquo;s
														conclusion that the
														final fix to the bearing
														issue is the redesign of
														the wheel hub assembly,
														which is now underway.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												The final Safety Note from RTG
												and Alstom, outlines the
												following parameters of the plan
												for the safe operations of Line
												1:
												<ul>
													<li>
														Continue with all
														mitigation measures
														already in place
													</li>
													<li>
														Replacement of the
														leading and trailing
														wheel hub assemblies and
														axles every 60,000
														kilometres
													</li>
													<li>
														Implement a new
														inspection regime for
														the middle bogies
													</li>
													<li>
														Avoid any contact
														between the wheel and
														the restraining rail.
														This is a new
														requirement received on
														Friday, July 28 based on
														the results of
														instrumented bogie
														tests.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ol>

										<p>
											Over the weekend, RTG, Alstom and OC
											Transpo with Transportation Resource
											Associates (TRA) worked to determine

													</li>
													<li>
														RTG informed us that the
														Safety Note requires
														additional actions to
														ensure that there is no
														contact between the
														train wheel and the
														restraining rail.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											RTG and Alstom have conducted
											numerous instrumented bogie tests,
											which have resulted in the need for
											additional track infrastructure work
											to ensure that the train wheels do
											not make contact with the
											restraining rail. The need for this
											additional work means that the
											gradual resumption of service,
											initially anticipated to occur on
											July 31, will be delayed.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo is working with RTG to
											determine the next steps, including
											a new risk assessment for the work
											to ensure that the track
											infrastructure conforms to the new
											Safety Note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											Work on the risk assessment and next
											steps for adjusting rail
											infrastructure will proceed through
											the weekend. Once the risk
											assessment is complete, it will take
											approximately 10 days to complete
											the track infrastructure work.
										</p>

										<p>
											More information on the requirements

											provided on Monday, July 31.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the interim, RTG will continue to

											operation, when it is determined
											service can safely resume.<br />

											OC Transpo recognizes that the
											ongoing service disruption is
											frustrating for our customers.
											However, the safety of our customers

										<p>
											This memo is to provide an update to
											the Mayor and Members of Council on
											the ongoing O-Train Line 1 service
											disruption and the safe, gradual
											return to service.
										</p>

										<p>
											At this time, OC Transpo continues
											to anticipate that the gradual
											resumption of service will begin on
											Monday, July 31. In order to safely
											resume service, three items are
											required:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Inspection of all rail vehicles,
												which was completed on July 24;
												six vehicles are undergoing
												additional investigations
											</li>
											<li>
												Texelis report based on the
												manufacturer&rsquo;s disassembly
												and analysis of the out of
												tolerance axle hub, expected on
												July 28
											</li>
											<li>
												Safety Note from Alstom and RTG,
												outlining the parameters of the
												new containment plan for the
												safe operations of Line 1
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											Earlier today, Alstom and RTG
											provided the draft Safety Note. The
											document is being reviewed by OC
											Transpo. At a high level, the Safety
											Note lays out plans for a new
											inspection and replacement regime
											that requires:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Continuing with all mitigation
												measures already in place
											</li>
											<li>
												Replacement of the leading and
												trailing wheel hub assemblies
												and axles every 60,000
												kilometres
											</li>
											<li>
												Implement a new inspection
												regime for middle bogies
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											As a result of this enhanced
											inspection and replacement program,
											not all trains will be available to
											operate as they undergo wheel hub
											assembly replacement based on their
											current mileage. OC Transpo is
											committed to restoring O-Train
											service as soon as it is safe to do
											so. Based on this information,
											current reduced ridership levels,
											and that Line 1 can operate with
											either single or double-car trains,
											customers can expect the following
											progressive return to service:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Eight single-car trains serving
												all stations on Line 1,
												approximately every seven to
												eight minutes
											</li>
											<li>
												R1 bus service will continue to
												operate in parallel to Line 1
												service
											</li>
											<li>
												OC Transpo staff will continue
												to be at key stations to support
												customers during their trip
											</li>
											<li>
												The Transit Operations Control
												Centre will be closely
												monitoring passenger volumes at
												stations
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											This fleet size in combination with
											the ongoing R1 bus service will
											provide the capacity required to
											meet current customer volumes. This
											temporary single-car train
											configuration enables OC Transpo and
											RTG to manage the supply of rail
											vehicles while meeting the more
											frequent inspection and replacement
											regime in order to ensure the
											sustainable delivery of service.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo and Rideau Transit Group
											(RTG) conducted a risk assessment
											and confirmed that since the system
											was originally designed to
											accommodate both single and
											double-car train operations, there
											are no additional risks to customer
											safety at station platforms.
										</p>

										<p>
											As RTG progresses with the wheel hub
											assembly replacement, more trains
											will become available to maintain
											the sustainability of the eight
											trains in operation. Once OC Transpo
											can be assured that there is a
											sustainable number of vehicles
											available for service, we will
											assess an increase to the number of
											operating trains.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo continues to work with
											RTG and Alstom to finalize the
											Safety Note and the gradual safe
											return to service plan. Once plans
											are final, full details will be
											communicated to customers prior to
											the start of service through all of
											OC Transpo&rsquo;s channels.
										</p>

										<p>
											There will be a media availability
											at 4 p.m. today and we will continue
											to share information as it becomes
											available.

										</p>

										<p><strong>Inspections</strong>:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												The inspection of 44 light rail
												vehicles was completed
												yesterday. One out of service
												vehicle in Kingston will be
												inspected at a later date. Six
												(6) light rail vehicles are
												undergoing further inspections.
											</li>
											<li>
												Track measurements are being
												verified in the field prior to
												re-setting of the gauge.
											</li>
											<li>
												The restraining rail is being
												adjusted to an optimized
												position on several curves and
												this work is expected to be
												complete by July 30. This work
												will help minimize the contact
												between the wheel of the light
												rail vehicle and the rail to
												improve overall vehicle
												sustainability.
											</li>
											<li>
												The out of tolerance axle hub is
												in France; dismantling and
												analysis will commence shortly.
												The report from this
												investigation is expected by
												July 28.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Bogie tests</strong>:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												An instrumented bogie test train
												fitted with an out-of-tolerance
												axle hub will run along the line
												at regular speeds today to
												determine the vibration
												signature which will help with
												further analysis of the issues
												affecting the wheel hub
												assembly.

											</strong>
										</p>

										<p>
											Throughout the week, the Transit
											Operations Control Centre has been
											adjusting R1 service based on
											feedback from customers and
											collaboration with our partners in
											Traffic Services.
										</p>

										<p>
											Today, new enhancements and
											improvements were implemented and
											have improved service; this
											continues to be closely
											monitored.&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>Customers should know that:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												R1 bus service now uses Albert
												and Slater streets downtown,
												instead of Queen Street. For
												customers, this means:
												<ul>
													<li>
														Westbound R1 buses are
														running on Albert
														Street, with stops at
														Bank and Kent
													</li>
													<li>
														Eastbound R1 buses are
														running on Slater
														Street, with stops at
														Kent and O&rsquo;Connor
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Westbound R1 service is running
												from Blair to Tunney&rsquo;s
												Pasture, stopping at each
												station, except for Lees
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
												A shuttle operates between Lees,
												uOttawa, and Rideau stations.
												For customers, this means:
												<ul>
													<li>
														Customers travelling to
														Lees station from the
														east can connect with
														the shuttle and
														eastbound R1 service at
														uOttawa station
													</li>
													<li>
														Eastbound R1 service
														will continue serve Lees
														station
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
												A shuttle is running between
												Cyrville station and St-Laurent
												station in order to connect
												customers with R1 service
											</li>
										</ul>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Additional signage has been
												installed to inform customers
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											We encourage customers to visit
											<a

										<p>
											To:&nbsp;Mayor and Members of

										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;Michael Morgan, Director,
											Rail Construction Program, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide an update to the Mayor and
											Members of Council about the
											expansion of free transit service to
											children aged 12 and under.
										</p>

										<p>
											As approved in the 2023 budget,
											effective July 1, children aged 12
											and under ride OC Transpo for free.
											This includes OC Transpo buses,
											trains and Para Transpo. Previously,
											free service was available to
											children aged seven and under.
										</p>

										<p>
											The initiative, called &ldquo;Kids
											Go Free&rdquo;, will make transit
											more accessible to our younger
											residents and their families.
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Children taking a bus or Para
												Transpo can simply board without
												paying a fare.
											</li>
											<li>
												On O-Train Line 1, children can
												enter through an accessible
												(wide) fare gate along with a
												fare-paying adult.
											</li>
											<li>
												On buses, or at O-Train
												stations, children can also tap
												an OC Transpo child card
												(available for free at the OC
												Transpo Customer Service Centre
												at the Rideau Centre) or use a
												Presto card issued by a school
												board.
											</li>
											<li>
												Customer service agents are also
												available to help on video chat
												at ticket machines, at the
												information phone near the fare
												gates, or by calling 613-560-
												5000.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											As a result of this change, some of
											our fare products have changed,
											including:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Presto cards for a child fare
												are no longer required after
												July 1
											</li>
											<li>
												The Family DayPass has changed
												to the 2-for-1 DayPass.
												<ul>
													<li>
														Two customers aged 13 or
														older can take unlimited
														rides on a single
														DayPass.
													</li>
													<li>
														The 2-for-1 DayPass is
														available on weekends
														and statutory holidays.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												Child tickets, child transfers,
												and child DayPasses (1-day or
												multi-day) will no longer be
												required.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											Information on these changes is
											being shared through OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s customer
											communications channels, including
											<a
												href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/news/article/kids-go-free/"
												target="_blank"

											O-Train Line 1, buses and Para
											Transpo. To better support
											customers, OC Transpo will have
											additional service running
											throughout the day and into the
											evening. With the main event taking
											place at LeBreton Flats again this
											year, customers should travel to
											Lyon Station and follow Wellington
											Street to access the event site.
											Customers with accessibility
											requirements can use Pimisi Station.

											partnering with the
											<a
												href="https://transitapp.com/"
												target="_blank"
												>Transit app</a
											>
											to offer a subscription of their
											&ldquo;Royale&rdquo; service to all

											Transpo will also be retiring its
											current iPhone app. This information
											was shared with Transit Commission
											at its meeting in May.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong
												>Transit App - Royale</strong
											>
										</h5>

										<p>
											As of today, anyone who downloads or
											uses the latest version of the
											Transit app will have access to the
											expanded Royale service. App users
											must download the latest version
											(5.14.7) of the app to receive the
											Royale upgrade.
										</p>

										<p>
											The expanded service offers free
											additional features to what has
											existed to date, including:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Wider geographical range for
												real-time bus tracking
											</li>
											<li>
												Full transit schedule, instead
												of only short-term departures
											</li>
											<li>
												Fun interactive features such as
												theme options, a custom avatar
												and nicknames, and more!
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											In addition to the enhanced features
											noted above, customers can also
											check departure times, track their
											bus, and sign up to receive service
											alerts as notifications. Transit
											also offers interconnected trip
											planning for STO and OC Transpo
											services.

										<h5>
											<strong

										</h5>

										<p>
											OC Transpo is also retiring the OC

											The OC Transpo app no longer meets
											the needs of our customers, is
											limited to iOS mobile devices, and
											the departure data is not as
											accurate as it is on the Transit
											app.
										</p>

										<p>
											Retiring the OC Transpo app and
											moving to the Transit app will allow
											us to focus on improving our
											real-time data quality to improve
											the customer experience.
										</p>

										<p>
											Information about these two mobile
											developments will be communicated to
											customers through OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											information channels, including
											<a
												href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/"

										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											advise the Mayor and Members of
											Council that OC Transpo is advancing
											to the testing phase of the
											O-Payment system, a new and
											convenient way for customers to pay
											for their transit fare using credit
											card or mobile wallet.

										<p>
											New
											<a
												href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/news/article/new-fare-readers-on-buses"
												>smartcard fare readers</a
											>
											have been successfully installed on
											all O-Train Line 1 fare gates and
											the entire conventional bus fleet.
											Staff are now beginning testing of
											the fare readers at O-Train Line 1
											fare gates, and testing will begin
											on buses in early July. This testing
											will continue until O-Payment is
											ready to officially launch across
											the entire transit system, which is
											expected to occur in the coming
											months. As a reminder, credit card
											and mobile wallet payment options
											have been available for customer use
											on Para Transpo vehicles since April
											2023.
										</p>

										<p>
											During the testing period, customers
											may notice the VISA and Mastercard
											logos on fare reader screens. We ask
											that customers continue to pay using
											existing payment methods until
											testing is complete. Customers who
											wish to pay by credit card or mobile
											wallet at Line 1 stations can
											continue to do so at the specially
											marked white fare gates, which have
											been available as a trial for
											customers since early 2021.
											Customers are reminded to take their
											credit card out of their wallet when
											tapping.
										</p>

										<p>
											Details about system testing will be
											communicated to customers through OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s information
											channels, including
											<a
												href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/"
												>octranspo.com</a
											>, social media and printed
											material.
										</p>

										<p>
											More information will be provided in

										Summer 2023 Transit Service Changes
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											To: Mayor and Members of Council,
											Chair and Members of the Transit
											Commission
										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;General Manager, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of
											Council with an overview of OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s summer service
											changes, effective Sunday, July 2,
											2023. Regular schedule adjustments
											take place four times a year &ndash;
											spring, summer, fall and winter
											&ndash; and memos are provided in
											advance of each new schedule period.
										</p>

										<p>
											The summer service changes
											redistribute existing resources and
											include several types of changes:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Seasonal service changes</li>
											<li>
												Service adjustments for
												construction
											</li>
											<li>General service adjustments</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Seasonal Service
												Changes</strong
											>
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Line 2 bus service and Route 25
												will have minor frequency
												reductions during certain time
												periods on weekdays, to reflect
												reduced ridership levels
												normally seen on these routes
												during the summer.
											</li>
											<li>
												School Service will not operate
												during the summer.
											</li>
											<li>
												Summer weekend service to
												seasonal destinations will
												return on Route 25 to the Canada
												Aviation and Space Museum, on
												Route 139 to Petrie Island, and
												on Route 185 to the Canada
												Agriculture and Food Museum.
												Specific start dates will be
												provided on octranspo.com.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Service Adjustments for
												Construction</strong
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											As a result of various road
											reconstruction and other
											infrastructure projects, the
											following routes may experience
											delays and additional travel time:
										</p>

										<p>
											Route 16 and extensions of routes
											57, 61, 63, 66, and 75 from
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture to Gatineau
											due to road reconstruction on Scott
											Street between Parkdale Avenue and
											Bayview Road (westbound direction
											only).
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Routes 61, 63, 66, 75, and 85
												due to ongoing projects along
												the Chaudi&egrave;re Crossing.
												The existing route detours are
												expected to continue through
												much of the summer service
												period.
											</li>
											<li>
												Routes 10 and 16 due to ongoing
												road reconstruction along Albert
												Street and Slater Street,
												between Empress Avenue and Bay
												Street.
											</li>
											<li>
												Routes 11, 16, and 19 due to the
												ongoing rehabilitation project
												along the Mackenzie King Bridge.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 49 due to a detour to
												accommodate the infrastructure
												project on Valley Drive,
												impacting Pleasant Park Road.
											</li>
											<li>
												Routes 5 and 6 due to road
												reconstruction along Bank Street
												between Billings Bridge Station
												and Riverdale Avenue.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 7 due to a detour to
												accommodate road reconstruction
												on Grove Avenue from July
												through the duration of the
												summer service period.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											The Transitway, between Westboro
											Station and Lincoln Fields Station,
											will be detoured on a nightly basis
											throughout the summer service period
											due to Stage 2 construction:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												On weekdays, the detour will
												operate from 10:30 pm to 6 am.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekends, the detour will
												begin at 10:30 pm on Friday
												evenings and will remain in
												effect until 6 am on Monday
												mornings (6 am on Tuesday
												mornings in instances where
												Monday is a holiday).
											</li>
											<li>
												Passengers travelling this
												segment may experience increased
												travel times during the detour
												periods and walking distances
												may increase slightly for
												customers who normally connect
												at Dominion and Lincoln Fields
												stations.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											<strong
												>General Service
												Adjustments</strong
											>
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												As part of the regular review of
												schedules to improve service
												reliability for customers,
												schedule adjustments will be
												made to routes 6, 7, 48, 85,
												252, 256, 257, 258, 261, 264,
												and 272 on weekdays.
											</li>
											<li>
												The first westbound trips on
												Route 38 that start at Place
												d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans Station
												will be extended to start at
												Trim Station.
											</li>
											<li>
												On weekdays, supplemental trips
												on Route 88 will be added
												between Baseline and Hurdman
												stations, to better reflect
												ridership levels.
											</li>
										</ul>

												information, downloading an
												independent app, signing up for
												text alerts to receive the
												latest information, checking
												transit information screens at
												many major stations, and

												information is also available by
												calling 613-560-1000 plus the
												bus stop number.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											These summer service changes will be
											evaluated based on feedback we
											collect from customers and operating
											staff, as well as ridership and
											operational data measurements. Our
											goal is to continue to provide
											excellent service for customers as
											their travel needs change.
										</p>

										O-Train Line 1 Annual Track and

											To:&nbsp;Mayor and Members of
											Council
										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;General Manager, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											This memo is to advise Members of
											Council that Rideau Transit Group
											will be performing work on O-Train
											Line 1 at varying times for two
											weeks, from Monday, June 5 until
											Monday, June 19. Train service will
											continue to be delivered, but R1 bus
											service will be required in some
											sections.
										</p>

										<p>
											All light rail systems require
											regular maintenance to ensure their
											long-term sustainability and
											reliability. This year&rsquo;s
											maintenance work includes the
											following activities:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Work to address water
												infiltration in the tunnel, east
												of Rideau Station
											</li>
											<li>
												Annual rail grinding across the
												entire line to reduce noise and
												vibration
											</li>
											<li>
												Overhead Catenary System, switch
												and track related maintenance
												and inspections
											</li>
											<li>
												The removal of vegetation within
												the guideway
											</li>
											<li>
												General maintenance and cleaning
												activities including the
												cleaning of glass and artwork,
												paint removal at specific
												locations in downtown tunnel
												stations, concrete, and tile
												repairs
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											During the work, O-Train Line 1
											service will continue, but R1 bus
											service will operate in some
											sections of the line at specific
											times. The schedule below provides a
											full outline of service during this
											period.
										</p>

										<p>
											Where possible, maintenance will
											occur during the evening hours to
											minimize impacts to customer travel.
											There are eight days, however, where
											R1 bus service will operate on a
											portion of the line for the full
											day.
										</p>

										<p>
											Here is the service schedule for the
											two-week period:

										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;Michael Morgan, Director,
											Rail Construction Program, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The following memo outlines the
											progress made during Q1 2023 on the
											Stage 2 project and provides an
											overview of the planned work for Q2
											2023.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong
												>Stage 2 Trillium Line Project
											</strong>
										</h5>

										<h6><u>Schedule</u></h6>

										<p>
											The City has been working closely
											with TransitNEXT to advance critical
											works that would enable the handover
											of the system to the City this year.
											Based on the current review of all
											inputs including an agreement on the
											training requirements, the current
											working timeline for the project
											handover is the beginning of
											October.
										</p>

										<p>
											Subsequent to project handover, the
											City will make an assessment
											regarding the timing for start of
											public service. Final readiness
											activities and an assessment of
											system maturity will be made after
											handover from the build team.
										</p>

										<p>
											Note that this timeline is based on
											the information we have available
											and assumes that completion of
											remaining milestones will be
											relatively smooth. There remains
											some risk and uncertainty in the
											completion of the remaining works.
										</p>

										<p>
											The achievement of the handover
											milestone is contingent upon:
										</p>

										<ol>
											<li style="margin-left: 17.85pt">
												completion of trackwork
											</li>
											<li style="margin-left: 17.85pt">

											</li>
											<li style="margin-left: 17.85pt">
												regulatory approvals by
												Transport Canada
											</li>
											<li style="margin-left: 17.85pt">
												training completion
											</li>
										</ol>

										<h6><u>Design </u></h6>

										<p>
											Staff worked with TransitNEXT in Q1
											2023 to continue resolving open
											comments for stations, guideways,
											and maintenance facilities. Staff
											reviewed issues for construction
											drawings for the Hunt Club Rail
											Bridge and the final design
											submissions for the communication
											systems.
										</p>

										<p>
											Final signage and wayfinding shop
											drawings for the stations and
											Walkley Maintenance and Storage
											Facility (MSF) have also been
											submitted by TransitNEXT for a final
											accuracy review by Transit Services.
										</p>

										<h6>
											<u
												>Construction &ndash; Highlights
											</u>
										</h6>

										<p>
											During Q1 2023, the construction of
											all 13 Trillium Line stations
											continued, including elevator
											installation, platform work,
											utilities work, aluminium composite
											panels (ACM) and shelter
											installation, painting, glazing
											installation, communications cable
											pulling, mechanical, electrical and
											plumbing work. The main breaker at
											Corso Italia, Carleton, Greenboro
											and Airport stations were energized
											during this period.
										</p>

										<p>
											Work progressed in the Dow&rsquo;s
											Lake Tunnel and pump house with
											cable pulling and termination of jet
											fan electrical connections.
										</p>

										<p>
											Works progressed at the new Walkley
											Yard Facility (MSF), including epoxy
											flooring installation, commissioning
											of the HVAC system and various
											equipment that will be used on the
											trains. Work progressed in the train
											wash building with the installation
											of the energy recovery unit, floor
											grating and overhead doors. The
											train wash building was energized on
											permanent power during Q1 2023.
											Electrical, mechanical and HVAC
											rough-in scope also progressed at
											the inspection building.
										</p>

										<p>
											Trackwork progressed along the
											entire alignment including track
											welding, destressing, and surfacing.
											Special trackwork installation
											continued at the Bayview and
											Limebank cross-over, and turnouts
											were also installed at various
											sections of the alignment. Direct
											fixation (DF) track installation
											started during Q1 2023 at Ellwood
											and Airport elevated guideways.
										</p>

										<p>
											Hunt Club bridge works continued in
											Q1 2023 with the barrier walls
											between the rail and pathway
											completed, median barrier wall
											started, and remaining bridge
											approach work progressed during Q1
											2023. Bridge works on the elevated
											guideway at Ellwood and the airport
											are nearing completion.
										</p>

										<h6><u>Handover</u></h6>

										<p>
											Following the completion of
											construction and then testing and
											commissioning program, TransitNEXT
											will begin a three-week trial
											running period to validate that all
											aspects of the system and
											maintenance activities perform as
											expected.
										</p>

										<p>
											Following the successful completion
											of Trial Running as well as
											completion of all PA requirements,
											Substantial Completion will be
											achieved.
										</p>

										<p>
											The system will then be available
											for OC Transpo to complete any
											remaining operational readiness
											activities before determining a
											final opening date to the public.
											The duration of this final process
											for validation of system readiness
											is still to be determined.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong>Stage 2 </strong
											><strong
												>Confederation Line Project
											</strong>
										</h5>

										<h6><u>Schedule</u></h6>

										<p>
											The East extension is currently
											forecasting a completion date of
											January 16, 2025, which is an
											approximate 7-week delay from the
											Project Agreement (PA) completion
											date of November 26, 2024 &ndash;
											this is a slight reduction from
											previous reports.
										</p>

										<p>
											On the West extension, from
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture Station to
											Moodie and Algonquin stations, the
											City is expecting a delay of up to
											17 months against the contractual
											completion date of May 25, 2025.
											Specific elements such as the light
											maintenance and storage facility
											(LMSF) and Lincoln Fields Station
											are progressing well. Production
											rates and accumulated delays on the
											Cut and Cover Tunnel along the Kichi
											Zibi Mikan and Byron Linear Park are
											pushing the overall project
											completion date to late 2026.
										</p>

										<p>
											Note that the project has two
											independent opening dates, with the
											eastern extension segment, from
											Blair Station to Trim Station,
											planned to open first.
										</p>

										<h6><u>Design </u></h6>

										<p>
											In Q1 2023, City staff continued
											their review of EWC&rsquo;s designs
											of specific Confederation Line
											extension elements, including
											stations. The focus is now on
											closing open comments on design
											packages. In Q1 2023, staff
											continued the review of design
											documents for stations and remaining
											roads packages.
										</p>

										<p>
											The review of other works that will
											be completed following Substantial
											Completion, including the Richmond
											Road Complete Streets and the
											decommissioning of portions of the
											Transitway, will continue in Q2
											2023.
										</p>

										<p>
											There is now a focus on review of
											testing and commissioning plans and
											documents that are now being
											provided by EWC.
										</p>

										</p>

										<p>
											Rail and rail tie delivery to the
											LMSF started in Q4 2022, and rail
											welding and installation began in Q1
											2023. Energization of the TPSS
											building at the LSMF is complete.
											Catenary poles and catenary work are
											expected following installation of
											rail this spring.
										</p>

										<p>
											In the east, the majority of the
											23-kilometre guideway barrier wall
											between the rail guideway and the
											highway has been completed.
										</p>

										<p>
											Overhead Catenary System (OCS) pole
											and cable trough installation

											stations have been delivered and
											installed. The remaining three TPSS
											units in the East will be delivered
											in Q2 2023. Racks and cabinet
											installation as well as cable
											pulling started in the Train Signal
											equipment rooms in the East stations
											and will continue in Q2 2023.
										</p>

										<p>
											Finishing works at Montr&eacute;al
											and Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc stations
											continues. Footings and foundation
											walls work at Convent Glen Station
											were completed in Q1 2023,
											underground mechanical and
											electrical, slab-on-grade and steel
											erection work will continue in Q2
											2023. Framing and sheet rock work
											continued at Place
											d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans Station. The
											concourse level pour has been
											completed at Trim Station.
											Escalators were delivered and
											installed at Place
											d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans and Trim
											stations.
										</p>

										<h6><u>Handover</u></h6>

										<p>
											The handover sequence for the Stage
											2 Confederation Line is different
											than in Stage 1. Following
											completion of the infrastructure and
											system commissioning by EWC, a
											three-week trial running period
											involving City operations, Rideau
											Transit Group and Rideau Transit
											Maintenance and EWC will be
											completed to verify operation and
											maintenance of the completed system.
											Following this work, additional time
											may be used for trial operations
											prior to opening for passenger
											service.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong
												>Stage 2 Project
												Vehicles</strong
											>
										</h5>

										<p>
											RTG is providing 38 additional
											Alstom Citadis Spirit light rail
											vehicles to ensure that the expanded
											Stage 2 Confederation Line operates
											as a single, uniform service. To
											date, 10 Stage 2 vehicles have been
											accepted and are in use as part of
											the operating fleet.
										</p>

										<p>
											Configuration updates, software
											change, reliability and performance
											modifications that have been
											identified through Line 1 service
											since 2019, are being applied to the
											Stage 1 vehicles and to the Stage 2
											vehicles in order to create a
											homogeneous fleet. Additional
											vehicles are undergoing final
											commissioning now and the fleet size
											is expected to be sufficient for the
											east extension by the end of this
											year. The remaining fleet order is
											expected to arrive well ahead of the
											west extension timelines.
										</p>

										<p>
											TransitNEXT will supply seven
											Stadler FLIRT vehicles for the
											expanded Trillium Line, which have
											already been delivered to Ottawa.
											The existing Alstom LINT fleet have
											undergone a retrofit program and are
											now ready for systemwide testing and
											commissioning.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong>Stage 1 and Stage 2 </strong
											><strong>Contingency Funds</strong>
										</h5>

										<p>
											The Stage 1 Confederation Line
											contingency fund is $115 million. To
											date, $100.03 million from the total
											fund has been spent. Remaining funds
											are primarily related to property
											requirements and remaining
											commercial matters.
										</p>

										<p>
											The original Stage 2 contingency
											fund of approximately $152 million
											was increased by $25 million due to
											unforeseen costs and improvements to
											the project, as approved by Council
											on July 6, 2022. Approximately $166
											million of the Stage 2 contingency
											fund has been committed to date.
											Additional pressures remain on the
											contingency due to project delays
											increasing the cost for City
											oversight, existing and emerging
											variations for system improvements,
											residual project risks over the
											remainder of the project life, and
											open commercial issues.
										</p>

										<h5>
											<strong>Stage 1 and Stage 2 </strong
											><strong>Capital Budgets</strong>
										</h5>

										<p>
											In keeping with Council&rsquo;s
											approved 2017 Stage 2 Report
											(ACS2017- TSD-OTP-0001) and 2019
											Stage 2 Report
											(ACS2019-TSD-OTP-0001),
											approximately $3.019 billion has
											been spent as of March 31, 2023 and
											relates to the RTG MOU for Belfast
											Yard and vehicle assembly
											mobilization ($424M), Confederation
											Line extension mobilization and
											construction period payments
											($1.537B), Trillium Line extension
											construction period payments and
											financial close for the Revenue
											Vehicle Supply Contract ($602M), and
											contingency ($61M). The remaining
											$395M was spent for planning,
											procurement, project delivery and
											City retained scope.
										</p>

										<p>
											Notably, the City received the final
											$60M payment from the MTO for Stage
											1 on March 15, 2023 and received the
											final $60M payment from Transport
											Canada for Stage 1 in two
											installments, $5.8M on April 12,
											2023 and $54.2M on April 18, 2023.
											No funds are outstanding and the
											funding agreements for Stage 1 of
											the Confederation Line are now
											closed. The City will continue to
											report on critical reliability
											issues on the Confederation Line to
											the funding partners as part of the
											Stage 2 funding agreement.

										Supporting OC Transpo customers on
										Twitter
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											To:&nbsp;Mayor and Members of
											Council
										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;Ren&eacute;e Amilcar,
											General Manager, Transit Services
											Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide Mayor and Members of Council
											with information on changes to OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s Twitter accounts
											that are designed to support
											customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo began using Twitter in
											2010; it has since gained close to
											82,000 followers and shared almost
											400,000 updates across three
											accounts. In that time, social media
											has significantly evolved, as have
											customer expectations.
										</p>

										<p>
											As part of OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											commitment to implementing industry
											best practices, increasing
											responsiveness to customer
											inquiries, improving overall
											communications, and building public
											trust, OC Transpo is relaunching its
											Twitter accounts.
										</p>

										<p>
											Starting today, &ldquo;<a
												href="https://twitter.com/OC_TranspoHelps"
												>OC_TranspoHelps&rdquo;</a
											>
											and &ldquo;<a
												href="https://twitter.com/OC_TranspoAide"
												>OC_TranspoAide</a
											>&rdquo; are replacing the
											&ldquo;OCTranspoLive&rdquo; and
											&ldquo;OCTranspoDirect&rdquo;
											accounts. These new customer
											service-focused Twitter accounts are
											managed by customer service
											representatives who are empowered to
											quickly respond to customer
											inquiries and provide support.
										</p>

										<p>
											Detours, major disruptions, and
											other important service alerts will
											continue to be shared on these
											accounts. This complements OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s organizational
											account, &ldquo;OC_Transpo&rdquo;,
											which provides system-wide updates
											and general information for
											customers, such as links to the Next
											Stop Blog posts.
										</p>

										<p>
											While some customers may have used
											the previous Twitter accounts to
											find changes to their specific bus
											trips, this is no longer possible.
											Twitter has introduced new pricing
											to access certain features of their
											platform, which would add a cost of
											approximately $675,600 per year to
											continue to post specific trip
											information.
										</p>

										<p>
											This update to OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											Twitter presence is also a component
											of a plan to improve communications
											with customers; further enhancements
											can be expected. These improvements
											will complement ongoing work to
											upgrade real-time data information
											for customers. Additional
											information on the real-time data
											project will be provided at the May
											11 Transit Commission meeting.
										</p>

										<p>
											Customers can continue to find
											specific bus trip information, like
											bus departure times, by:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												<a
													href="https://www.octranspo.com/en/"
													>Visiting octranspo.com</a
												>
												and using the next departures
												widget on the homepage
											</li>
											<li>
												<a
													href="https://www.octranspo.com/alert-registration/register/"
													>Signing up for MyAlerts</a
												>
											</li>

													href="https://plan.octranspo.com/plan"
													>Using the Travel
													Planner.</a
												>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											OC Transpo will be communicating
											with customers on our channels to
											inform them of this change.
										</p>

										<p>
											We would be grateful for your
											assistance in communicating this
											change to residents. Attached are
											some sample social media posts to
											assist in sharing this information.
										</p>

									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											To:&nbsp;Mayor and Members of

										</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;General Manager, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide Members of Council and the
											Transit Commission with an update
											regarding the temporary scaffolding
											located at Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture
											and Hurdman stations. This
											scaffolding was installed in late
											2019 to provide additional weather
											protection for customers along some
											sections of the bus platforms.
										</p>

										<p>
											As directed by City Council at its
											meeting of March 1, 2023, the
											temporary scaffolding will be
											removed in May. At Tunney&rsquo;s
											Pasture Station, the work will start
											as early as May 1, and is expected
											to take up to 14 days. At Hurdman
											Station, the work will start as
											early as May 11, and will last up to
											10 days. The work will take place
											overnight, between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.
											and will not result in impacts for
											customers at the stations.
										</p>

										<p>
											As directed by Council, staff are
											preparing a proposal, including a
											cost breakdown, of potential
											permanent solutions for both
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture and Hurdman
											stations.&nbsp;Staff are examining
											the feasibility and cost of
											installing permanent improved
											weather protection for Hurdman
											Station and the south-side bus
											platforms at Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture
											Station, which will remain in use
											after the opening of the Stage 2
											extensions. In addition, staff are
											also examining interim improved
											weather protection for the
											north-side bus platforms at
											Tunney&rsquo;s Pasture Station,
											which are to be removed from service
											following the Stage 2 west
											extension.
										</p>

										<p>
											Staff will assess what work is
											feasible within the current capital
											authority and what work would
											require additional funding authority
											for consideration through the future
											capital budget process. The proposal
											will be presented to the Transit
											Commission once it is complete, and
											in advance of the 2024 budget
											discussions.
										</p>

										New ways to pay on Para Transpo
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From: General Manager, Transit
											Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											advise the Mayor and Members of
											Council that new convenient ways for
											customers to pay their fares on Para
											Transpo are now available. As
											mentioned at the Transit Commission
											meeting on April 13, all Para
											Transpo minibuses and taxis now have
											smartcard readers installed,
											providing customers with more
											options to pay for their fare,
											including a Presto card, a credit
											card, or a credit card in a mobile
											wallet on a smartphone.
										</p>

										<p>
											Adding smartcard readers to Para
											Transpo vehicles simplifies the
											customer experience, as customers no
											longer need to provide a receipt as
											proof of payment. Customers can
											simply buy a Presto card, register
											it at prestocard.ca, add their
											monthly pass or load funds to their
											e-Purse, and use the card to pay for
											their fare when they board.
										</p>

										<p>
											Payment by credit card will always
											charge a full Adult fare. The option
											to pay with a debit card will also
											be introduced soon, and customers
											continue to have the option to pay
											for their trips with cash or their
											ParaPay account.
										</p>

										<p>
											Customers with existing discounts on
											their ParaPay accounts can call
											613-560-5000 to have their discount
											transferred to a Presto card.
											Age-based discounts including Senior
											discounts can be added to a card in
											person at participating Shoppers
											Drug Mart, Loblaws and Real Canadian
											Superstore locations or at the OC
											Transpo Customer Service Centre at
											the Rideau Centre.
										</p>

										<p>
											Information will be communicated to
											customers through OC Transpo&rsquo;s
											information channels, including a
											public service announcement, printed
											material, social media updates, and
											octranspo.com.<br />
											Should you have any questions or
											comments about any of the points in
											this memo, please contact Pat
											Scrimgeour, Director, Transit

										Stage 2 Confederation Line Project -
										Support Oversight Appointments
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From: Director, Rail Construction
											Program
										</p>

										<p>
											The following memorandum provides
											Mayor and Council with information
											regarding appointments to the Stage
											2 Confederation Line Project
											extensions in the east and west of
											the city to support the delivery and
											startup of the project, and provides
											additional information in advance of
											the technical briefing scheduled for
											April 19, 2023 at 2 p.m. A previous
											iteration of this memorandum (also
											attached for reference) provided
											details on the oversight
											appointments on the Stage 2 Trillium
											Line extension.
										</p>

										<p>
											As a starting point, it is worth
											noting that there are significant
											differences between the startup of a
											new rail line, such as in Stage 1 of
											the Confederation Line, and the work
											to extend an operational railway as
											with the Stage 2 project. For a new
											startup, testing activities are
											completed in a closed environment
											and the work is generally isolated
											from end users. For an extension
											project, the work can be completed
											in a closed environment to begin
											with but, eventually, requires
											integration and testing of the
											interfaces between the new sections
											and the existing section. The
											availability of existing
											infrastructure and vehicles helps to
											simplify testing of some elements of
											an extension project but also
											creates additional complexities at
											the boundary between the new
											infrastructure and the existing
											infrastructure. The various
											oversight roles described below have
											been organized to match the
											complexity of the Stage 2 program.
										</p>

										<p>
											These appointments address
											Recommendation #28 from the Ottawa
											Light Rail Public Inquiry related to
											oversight, systems integration, and
											independent certification of the new
											rail lines.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Stage 2 Systems
												Integration</strong
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											As noted in previous updates to
											Council, the Stage 2 Confederation
											Line Project Agreement (PA) adopts
											lessons learned from Stage 1 and
											uses a different strategy for
											dealing with systems integration and
											verification of project
											requirements.
										</p>

										<p>
											The Confederation Line PA requires
											that East West Connectors (EWC)
											undertake a robust approach to
											systems engineering and integration
											activities based on a systems
											engineering approach defined by
											European Standards EN 50126 and
											ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 standards.
										</p>

										<p>
											These standards establish a defined
											framework for the implementation of
											systems engineering and integration
											activities within project life cycle
											stages. Simply put, the framework
											defines what systems engineering and
											integration activities need to take
											place during each project phase
											using a regimented engineering
											management approach. This process
											ensures that the necessary
											interfaces and interactions between
											the different project components,
											including infrastructure,
											facilities, subsystems, software,
											operations, and maintenance, have
											been identified and engineered to
											function together as a holistic
											system. The application of these
											standards will support these
											interdependent systems coming
											together to form a safe and reliable
											transit service.
										</p>

										<p>
											To assist with these activities, the
											City and EWC have jointly engaged a
											System Integration Verifier (SIV)
											who will assist the parties in
											confirming the system integration
											requirements as between the
											City&rsquo;s work on the Transit
											Operations Control Centre and the
											connections to field equipment
											provided by EWC. The SIV is a
											third-party independent function
											that provides verification services
											to both the City and EWC as part of
											the Stage 2 systems integration
											works. The role of the SIV is to
											monitor critical system
											implementation and integration
											milestones and certify that the
											testing has validated their
											successful implementation.
										</p>

										<p>
											The Stage 2 SIV contract has been
											awarded to Ingerop, an international
											French multi-disciplinary
											engineering firm, with over 2,300
											employees and 50 branches worldwide.
											Areas of specialization cover
											transport systems integration,
											signaling and CBTC, catenary and
											other railway systems. Ingerop has
											been involved with LRT and Metro
											projects worldwide, including Line
											15-SouthGrand Paris (France) Metro,
											Line 18 GrandParis Metro, T9 Paris
											tramway, Line 1and 3 Lima Metro
											(Per&uacute;), L3 Seville Metro
											(Spain), Granada LRT (Spain),
											M&aacute;laga Metro (Spain),
											Zaragoza LRT (Spain), Madrid ML1,
											ML2 and ML3LRT projects (Spain),
											Medell&iacute;n tramway (Colombia)
											and Line 1 Mexico DB (Mexico).
										</p>

										<p>
											The Stage 2 Confederation Line
											Project Agreement also requires that
											KEV (Kiewit, Eurovia, and Vinci)
											undertake a vigorous system safety
											assurance process to certify that
											all elements of the new expanded
											system are safe prior to the start
											of revenue operations. KEV&rsquo;s
											system safety and assurance process
											is guided by European Standards EN
											50126 which defines Reliability,
											Availability, Maintainability and
											Safety (RAMS) activities during each
											project phase. This iterative
											approach to system safety and
											assurance &ndash; leading to a
											Safety Case compliant with the
											European Standard EN 50129 - ensures
											that KEV is regularly reviewing,
											defining, and improving upon its
											safety tasks during each project
											phase. These standards establish a
											defined framework for the
											implementation of systems
											integration activities within
											project life cycle stages. Simply
											put, the framework defines what
											systems integration activities need
											to take place during each project
											phase using a regimented project
											management approach. As part of the
											Project Agreement, KEV is required
											to provide a Systems Integration
											Manager with at least 15
											years&rsquo; experience in this area
											to manage this scope.
										</p>

										<p>
											<strong
												>Stage 2 Independent
												Oversight</strong
											>
										</p>

										<p>
											The City is overseeing all aspects
											of the safety certification process
											through a joint team of City staff,
											external specialist consultants, and
											an independent safety auditor. The
											auditor will confirm that
											KEV&rsquo;s approach to system
											safety and assurance is sound, and
											that it has fulfilled compliance
											with all safety requirements
											throughout each project phase. The
											City has engaged SENER Inc. as the
											safety auditor, an international
											engineering and technology firm with
											wide experience in safety auditing
											and acceptance services. SENER is a
											certified Railway Independent Safety
											Auditor (ISA) that has provided ISA
											services throughout the world,
											including metro line 9 to the
											Barcelona International Airport
											(Spain), the Zapopan to Guadalajara
											and Tlaquepaque LRT system (Mexico),
											and the Lusail LRT Tramway (Qatar).
										</p>

										<p>
											As is the standard model for this
											type of project, an Independent
											Certifier (IC) has been engaged to
											actively review the progress of
											works on site and authorize payments
											for works completed. The IC assigned
											to the Stage 2 Confederation Line
											Project, AW Hooker, is actively
											reviewing project progress and
											certifying payments as part of their
											services to the Project. The
											IC&rsquo;s role is bound by the
											Project Agreement and the City can
											rely on their services for
											completion of the contractual
											requirements.
										</p>

										<p>
											In addition to the Project Agreement
											requirements outlined above, a
											variety of independent regulatory
											bodies, including the City&rsquo;s
											Building Code Services, the
											Technical Standards &amp; Safety

											The works and oversight described
											are in relation to the
											infrastructure being delivered by
											EWC only. In order to provide a
											complete view of the expanded
											Confederation Line, it is important
											to outline the various inputs that
											are required for vehicles, systems,
											infrastructure, operations and
											maintenance and how they are
											verified and validated as a complete
											unit.
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												RTG provided an expansion to the
												Stage 1 Belfast Yard for
												additional storage and
												additional maintenance
												capability and RTG is providing
												an additional 38 Alstom Citadis
												vehicles as part of the Stage 2
												Fleet Expansion including the
												safety certification for the
												individual vehicles;
											</li>
											<li>
												EWC is designing and
												constructing the expanded
												Confederation Line, and will
												safety certify the delivery of
												their works which includes the
												Thales safety case for the
												integrated Stage 1 and Stage 2
												train control system;
											</li>
											<li>
												The City&rsquo;s Rail
												Construction Program team is
												providing an expansion and
												upgrade of key communication
												systems (SCADA, CCTV, PIS/PA,
												etc.) at the Transit Operations
												Control Centre (TOCC) to be able
												to support the expanded systems;
											</li>
											<li>
												RTG through their subcontractor
												RTM will be mobilizing and
												preparing to provide expanded
												maintenance services; and,
											</li>
											<li>
												The City&rsquo;s Transit
												Services team will be mobilizing
												and preparing to provide
												expanded operational services.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											SENER, as Independent Safety
											Auditor, will provide a safety audit
											of the complete, expanded system on
											behalf of the City to ensure that
											the integrated solution meets the
											safety requirements.
										</p>

										<p>
											Moreover, the coordination and
											integration of various scopes of
											work will be demonstrated as an
											integrated system through the Trial
											Running period. The Trial Running
											period, in the context of a system
											extension, is an EWC contractual
											requirement to test and exercise the
											respective System Infrastructure,
											including all subsystems, that
											comprise the relevant works,
											operating personnel and operating
											procedures to demonstrate the East
											Works and West Works can reliably
											implement passenger service without
											interruptions. Further details on
											the Trial Running process for the
											Confederation Line will be provided
											in 2024 and the full definition of
											Trial Running is provided in

										Bus Route Review Public Consultations
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From: Ren&eacute;e Amilcar, General
											Manager, Transit Services Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											advise the Mayor and Members of
											Council that, as part of OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s Bus Route Review
											discussed at Transit Commission,
											consultations with Council and the
											public process will begin shortly.
										</p>

										<p>
											With changes to ridership since the
											onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
											with the upcoming opening of the
											Stage 2 O-Train extensions, there is
											a need to optimize our existing
											transit system.
										</p>

										<p>
											This review aligns with the ongoing
											City service reviews being
											coordinated by the Service Review
											Working Group. Upon the conclusion
											of this process, OC Transpo will be
											able to optimize routes to support
											residents&rsquo; changing transit
											needs, while also responding to new
											realities, such as hybrid work, and
											to make policy recommendations to
											Council, if required.
										</p>

										<p>
											As part of the review, transit
											customers, Councillors, customer
											advocacy groups, major employers, OC
											Transpo employees and other
											stakeholders will be engaged in a
											variety of different consultations:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												Briefings with Councillors on
												the review will be scheduled
												soon.
											</li>
											<li>
												At the end of April, a dedicated
												webpage and survey will be
												launched on OCTranspo.com. The
												webpage will provide additional
												information about the route
												review and the survey will be
												the first opportunity for
												customers to provide input on
												how they use the Ottawa&rsquo;s
												transit system, and what they
												want the future of transit in
												Ottawa to look like.
											</li>
											<li>
												In the coming months, there will
												also be public consultations
												held in various locations across
												the city to allow for further
												public input.
											</li>
										</ul>

										<p>
											Transit Services will be providing
											Councillors with information
											packages to facilitate outreach in
											their wards.
										</p>

										<p>
											To support the work required to
											complete this review, the core
											project team has engaged Dillon
											Consulting. Dillon was prequalified
											for this type of work through the
											City&rsquo;s standing offer list.
											They will be working closely with
											our subject matter experts and bring
											expertise in planning, engineering,
											environmental science, and
											management.

										<p>
											This work must occur for Rideau
											Transit Group (RTG) to assess the
											scope of required repairs to prevent
											water infiltration in sections of
											the tunnel. This type of regular
											maintenance is common for
											underground tunnels, and there are
											no safety concerns.
										</p>

										<p>
											This RTG assessment is necessary and
											will provide the basis for the
											development of a workplan for
											scheduled tunnel maintenance work in
											June. Information about this June
											maintenance work will be
											communicated to Council in advance.
										</p>

										<p>
											Information and reminders will be

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											provide the Mayor and Members of

											Transpo&rsquo;s spring service
											changes, effective Sunday, April 23,
											2023. Regular schedule adjustments
											take place four times a year &ndash;
											spring, summer, fall and winter
											&ndash; and memos are provided in
											advance of each new schedule period.
										</p>

										<p>
											The spring service change includes
											several types of changes:
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Service adjustments</li>
											<li>
												Service adjustments for
												construction
											</li>
											<li>Seasonal service changes</li>
										</ul>

											<strong>Service Adjustments</strong>
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												The weekday trip on Route 75
												that starts at Tunney&rsquo;s
												Pasture Station at 16:07 will be
												extended to end at the Minto
												Recreation Centre instead of
												Barrhaven Centre.
											</li>
											<li>
												Service on Route 97 to and from
												the Ottawa International Airport
												will be increased from every 30
												minutes to every 15 minutes
												through most of the service day,
												seven days a week. This will
												restore the frequency of service
												to the airport to what it was
												before changes were implemented
												in Summer 2021 as result of low
												ridership due to the COVID-19
												pandemic.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 228 will be adjusted to
												serve Chapel Hill Station.
											</li>
											<li>
												Route 231 will be extended in
												the morning to start on Innes
												Road, west of Frank Bender
												Street, to address idling
												concerns from nearby residents.
											</li>
											<li>
												As part of the regular review of
												schedules to improve reliability
												and service for customers,
												schedule adjustments will be
												made to the following routes:
												<ul>
													<li>
														On weekdays, O-Train
														Line 2 replacement bus
														service and routes 40,
														57, 88, 168, 170, 171,
														231, 261, and 263.

													<li>
														On weekends, routes 61,
														62, 63, and 88.
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												School service will be adjusted
												to better meet students&rsquo;
												travel needs.
												<ul>
													<li>
														A.Y. Jackson Secondary
														School: Select school
														trips on Route 161 will
														be adjusted to travel on
														Stonehaven Drive and
														Grassy Plains Drive,
														reducing the walking
														distance for students in
														the Stonehaven Drive /
														Old Richmond Road area.
													</li>
													<li>
														Earl of March Secondary
														School: The afternoon
														school trip on Route 62
														will be extended to

										<p>
											<strong
												>Service Adjustments for
												Construction</strong
											>
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>
												With the completion of the
												Montr&eacute;al Road
												Revitalization Project last
												fall, routes 12 and 15 will
												revert to their pre-construction
												routing and hours of service,
												with Route 12 operating from
												Blair Station to Parliament
												Station seven days per week (no
												longer serving St-Laurent
												Station), and Route 15 operating
												during weekday peak periods
												only, between Blair Station and
												Gatineau (no longer operating in
												the midday or evening, nor on
												weekends, nor via Blair Road).
												Downtown, Route 12 will operate

											<strong
												>Seasonal Service
												Changes</strong
											>
										</p>

										<ul>
											<li>

									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>
											Following the discussions on the
											2023 draft budget at Transit
											Commission on February 9, some
											Members of Council have asked for
											more clarity regarding the draft
											budget and what it means for OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s customers. The
											purpose of this memo is to provide
											Members of Council with further
											information regarding OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s proposed 2023
											budget.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo is committed to
											delivering the best possible service
											for our customers and in this draft
											budget we are not proposing any
											overall service cuts. The budget
											process provides an opportunity to
											recalibrate our investments in our
											transit system and ensure we
											continue to meet the evolving needs
											of our customers. In the draft
											budget, OC Transpo is making needed
											investments to meet the new
											post-pandemic travel needs of our
											customers.
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo has both operating and
											capital budgets.
										</p>

										<p>
											The proposed operating budget for
											will be $17 million higher and
											includes significant service
											increases that will have a positive
											impact for customers. Operating
											budgets fund ongoing expenses such
											as staff salaries and diesel fuel
											costs
										</p>

										<p>
											The proposed capital budget for OC
											Transpo calls for new investments of
											$122 million, to add to the
											continued delivery of $782 million
											in previously approved capital
											projects. Capital budgets are used
											to make long-term investments in
											infrastructure and other assets.
										</p>

										<p>
											For customers, this means that they
											will continue to see improvements
											across the transit system due to
											investments within both the capital
											and operating budgets. At a high
											level this includes:

										<p>
											While making these investments in
											our service, the draft budget also
											takes a prudent approach to managing
											taxpayers&rsquo; money. For example,
											The City enters into hedging
											contracts for diesel fuel to provide
											greater budget certainty and guard
											against potential price
											fluctuations. The city fixes prices
											for 75% of the expected volume over
											the next eight months and hedges to
											lesser amounts further out on a
											rolling basis. Additionally, like
											many other transit agencies around
											the world, we are seeing increases
											in costs in many areas due to
											inflation. For items like fuel,
											wages and contracts the cost of
											inflation is about $28.1 million.
											Wages and contracts are increasing
											at the same pace as previous years,
											but the price of fuel is estimated
											to increase by 37% over 2022
											budgeted prices. The construction
											price index has increased to 6.3%,
											resulting in $6.2 million in added
											costs that must be accommodated in
											the capital budget.
										</p>

										<p>
											While there have been good increases
											in ridership in recent months, there
											are still about 30% of customers who
											are not expected to return in 2023,
											compared to 2019 levels, largely
											because many office workers are
											continuing to work full-time or
											part-time from home. This amounts to
											approximately a $53 million fare
											revenue shortfall. In January 2023,
											ridership was 62% compared to 2019
											levels, which is aligned with staff
											projections. This increase is based
											on the start of the gradual return
											to on-site work by employees of the
											federal government, the largest
											employer in Ottawa.
										</p>

										<p>
											To respond to the new and increasing
											costs and the fact that ridership
											and fare revenue remain below
											pre-pandemic levels, OC Transpo is
											proposing a number of savings for
											2023 that better align our costs
											with service levels that follow the
											needs of our customers.&nbsp;For
											example, prior to the pandemic OC
											Transpo required 851 conventional
											buses to deliver service. When
											ridership levels fell due to the
											pandemic, these buses were retained
											in the fleet because it was unknown
											how quickly the City economy and
											transit ridership levels would
											recover. Now that ridership patterns
											are more stable, this budget is
											proposing a realignment of OC
											Transpo&rsquo;s bus fleet size to
											738 to match actual service
											needs.&nbsp;For OC Transpo this
											means avoiding $4.4 million in
											maintenance costs and $3.7 million
											in capital costs in 2023 by retiring
											older vehicles.&nbsp;For customers
											this means the same number of buses
											on the road and the same schedules
											they are familiar with. No changes
											to service will be made because of
											this fleet realignment, and we will
											continue to have enough buses to
											meet the demands of our growing city
											for this year and next.&nbsp;&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											This and other prudent savings
											proposed in the draft budget allow
											us to provide a more reliable
											service and to continue to invest in
											customer improvements.
										</p>

										<p>
											In addition, due to the ongoing
											impacts of COVID-19, we have
											notified the province of needing $53
											million under the Safe Restart
											Agreement program to cover the
											shortfall in fare revenue. The City
											will need to receive at least $39
											million to balance the budget. This
											request is lower than previous years
											as we continue to lower our
											dependency on senior levels of
											government, while considering
											service delivery needs and financial
											risks.&nbsp;Should the Provincial
											contributions fall below the minimum
											requirements, we have alternative
											options ready, including drawing
											from reserves to make up the
											shortfall or bringing options for
											further cost savings to the Transit
											Commission for consideration.
										</p>

										<p>
											Following the adoption of the 2023
											budget, OC Transpo will also be
											undertaking a review of all bus
											routes. As ridership patterns have
											changed due to the pandemic, we must
											adapt the system to this new reality
											to continue to deliver the best
											possible service to our customers.
											This will involve evaluating
											potential future networks
											and&nbsp;identifying potential
											changes to service policy.
											Throughout this process
											consultations with customers and
											stakeholders will occur.
											Recommendations will be brought to
											Transit Commission later this year.
										</p>

										<p>
											As described above, OC Transpo
											continues to make investments to
											improve the customer experience and
											improve the service we deliver to
											them.&nbsp;

										Transportation Safety Board of Canada
										Rail Safety Advisory letter
									</h4>

									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>To: Mayor and Members of Council</p>

										<p>
											From:&nbsp;Ren&eacute;e
											Amilcar,&nbsp;General
											Manager,&nbsp;Transit Services
											Department
										</p>

										<p>
											The purpose of this memo is to
											inform Members of Council
											that&nbsp;the Transportation Safety
											Board of Canada (TSB) issued
											a&nbsp;Rail Safety Advisory (RSA)
											letterOpens in a new tab or
											window(link is external)&nbsp;on
											February 3, 2023,
											regarding&nbsp;O-Train Line 1
											vehicle axle bearing assemblies.
											This work is the result of its
											investigation that commenced after
											the August 2021 derailment and the
											July 2022 wheel axle hub event. OC
											Transpo and Rideau Transit Group
											(RTG) have reviewed the letter, met
											with TSB, and staff are now in a
											position to provide this letter to
											Council.
										</p>

										<p>
											The City of Ottawa has an agreement
											with TSB, setting out the process
											for both parties to conduct their
											own investigations on O-Train Line
											1. The City benefits from having TSB
											as external investigators for
											accidents and events, as it is an
											expert in post-incident
											investigations. TSB input has
											significantly contributed to
											enhancing the robust safety measures
											of our light rail system. Staff
											thank&nbsp;TSB&nbsp;for its timely
											investigations and communications,
											and City staff have fully cooperated
											with its work.
										</p>

										<p>
											After reviewing the letter, OC
											Transpo and RTG can confirm that all
											enhanced system safety measures in
											place align with TSB suggestions.
											RTG has provided the City with
											written confirmation that the
											O-Train Line 1 system is safe. Staff
											are currently reviewing TSB&rsquo;s
											findings in detail; this information
											will assist RTG in completing the
											final root cause analysis into the
											wheel axle hub assembly issue.&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											The safety of Transit customers is
											paramount. As discussed at Council
											in July 2022,&nbsp;out of an
											abundance of caution,&nbsp;while the
											root cause investigation of the axle
											bearing assembly is underway,
											enhanced mitigation measures are in
											place to ensure that the trains and
											system are safe:&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											In accordance with standard
											operating procedures, Rideau Transit
											Maintenance (RTM)
											inspects&nbsp;all&nbsp;light rail
											vehicles daily,&nbsp;prior to every
											launch&nbsp;
										</p>

										<p>
											All leading and trailing bogie axles
											are replaced when they
											reach&nbsp;175,000 km of service and
											are inspected for bearing assembly
											free play every 7,500 km
										</p>

										<p>
											The remaining axles are inspected at
											every 3,750 km when they exceed
											175,000 km
										</p>

										<p>
											Temporary&nbsp;Speed&nbsp;Restrictions
											are in place at&nbsp;several
											locations along the alignment
										</p>

										<p>
											OC Transpo hosts weekly status
											meetings on the root cause analysis
											with RTG, RTM, OLRT-C and its
											subcontractors
										</p>

										<p>
											RTG has installed vibration
											monitoring equipment on some trains
											and plans to expand the installation
											on additional vehicles in the coming
											months.
										</p>

										<p>
											The final root cause analysis is
											ongoing, and the recent settlement
											agreement with RTG implements a
											solid plan that actions the TSB
											recommendations to resolve these
											issues. Staff will present the
											findings and recommendations&nbsp;to
											Council for consideration once this
											is complete.&nbsp;The City continues
											to work collaboratively with RTG and
											is actively monitoring its work and
											progress. Our shared goal is to
											determine the final root cause of
											this issue and implement a solution
											that makes O-Train Line 1 operations
											sustainable and reliable.
